# [OpenFL and Haxe] Foundation Animation: Moving Things Move

Sample code translated to [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/) and [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) from [_Foundation ActionScript 3.0 Animation: Making Things Move_](http://www.apress.com/9781590597910) by Keith Peters (Apress, 2007).

Definitely [buy the book](http://www.apress.com/9781590597910) to dive into detailed explanations of the animation concepts demonstrated in these samples. It's really one of the best Flash books ever written, and the concepts are applicable to animation in any programming environment. Honestly, a version of this book should be available for every language. It's that good!

## Getting Started

Each chapter's sample code is configured as a separate OpenFL project. Compiling and running these samples to see them in action is easy!

1. Open a terminal and navigate to a chapter directory, such as _ch03_.
1. Run `openfl test html5` to compile and run the currently selected sample from that chapter in a web browser.

Most chapters contain several different samples, but they're all in one project. You can uncomment a specific sample in the chapter's _project.xml_ file, or you can use the `--app-main` command line option to choose a specific sample from the chapter.

```sh
openfl test html5 --app-main=SampleName
```
